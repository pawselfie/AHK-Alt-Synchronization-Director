# Alt Synchronization Director (AHK edition)
An AHK script that, utilizing Discord Webhooks and a GUI, makes moving alternate accounts fast and easy.

Notes:
This script uses [aqts](https://github.com/aqts-aqts)' [Natro Alt Synchronization](https://github.com/aqts-aqts/Natro-Alt-Synchronization) extension for [Natro Macro](https://github.com/NatroTeam/NatroMacro), so make sure to set it up before utilizing this script.
This script is a replica of my Python Alt Synchronization Director script, but utilising Discord Webhooks instead of your Discord Token, and a more user-friendly experience.

## Setup:
1. Set any alts you want to use this script on as "follower" accounts in [aqts](https://github.com/aqts-aqts)' [Natro Alt Synchronization](https://github.com/aqts-aqts/Natro-Alt-Synchronization) first, and keep track of which channel(s) you're using.
2. Download the files and place them in the same directory, the script won't run if 'config.ini' and 'map1.jpg' are not in the directory.
3. Open the script and configure up to 5 Webhooks in your Discord server, grab their URL and place them in each URL slot in the configuration page. You can check how to make a Webhook [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
4. Click "Save Settings", and then just "Go to Map".
5. If you ever need to change the configuration again, just go back to "Settings". Other than that you're good to go!

## Usage:
1. Select the webhook you want to send a message to.
2. Select which field to go to, and if you've set everything correctly, the alt account will reset/walk to hive, and travel to the field you selected.

## Useful Applications:
1. Robo Bear Challenge:
    -   Send up to 3 alts to the fields you need to complete quests of.
    -   Easily be able to keep precision mid-rounds, as sending the account takes no time.
    -   Even when using less than 3 alts, sending the alts to the next field can be done easily while playing as it only takes 2 clicks. 

2. Stick Bug Challenge:
    -   Send alts to far-away totems when you can't afford to spend the time to get them yourself.
    -   Be able to send them while fighting stick bug.

3. Remote Computers:
    -   Remotely control alts even if you cannot access the computer in which they are running.
    -   Have your friends run the macro in their computers if you cannot macro them while playing.
